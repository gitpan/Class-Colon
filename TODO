Here are things that I might add to Class::Colon

1. allow caller to supply split function which:
takes a line and returns an array (or anon. array) of strings, one per field
If you want real CSV, you can supply the proper function (see for example
Perl Cookbook 2nd ed. Recipe 1.20).
SPLITTER

2. allow the caller to supply the operative part of STRINGIFY
