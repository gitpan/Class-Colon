Here are things that I might add to Class::Colon

1. output
WRITE_FILE
WRITE_HANDLE

2. one at a time output
WRITE_HANDLE_OBJECT
WRITE_HANDLE_STRING
STRINGIFY

3. allow caller to supply split function which:
takes a line and returns an array (or anon. array) of strings, one per field
If you want real CSV, you can supply the proper function (see for example
Perl Cookbook 2nd ed. Recipe 1.20).
SPLITTER
